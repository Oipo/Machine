====== Reddit Makes A Game ======

===== What is this? =====
This Reddit community project called Reddit Makes A Game aims to produce a 
story-driven, high quality single-player game. 

In order to achieve this, the game is built separately from the engine.

===== How do I check it out? =====
You will need to build the engine in BaconGameEngine/ using make.
It should then be possible to launch the game directly in MachineGame/ by
issuing ./machine.py

===== How do I help? =====
